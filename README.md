# EAI_Final_Project
Final project for the Embedded AI Course.

This is a proof-of-concept project to re-route trains in real time. This could be used to route freight trains into sidings so passenger trains can pass them, without weeks of planning beforehand.

Arduino code is run from ArduinoInterface.py
Model training and tweaking is dine in KerasAI.py
AI.py is deprecated.

A pretrained model and some test images are provided for convience.
